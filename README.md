# CODSOFT - Data Science Internship

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains my solution for the first task of the Data Science Internship at CODSOFT. In this task, I worked on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

### Files:

- `TASK1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Titanic Survival Prediction task.


### Instructions:

1. **View the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook file `TASK1.ipynb` to view the Python code and analysis.

2. **Run the Code:**
   - To run the code on your local machine, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
   - Execute the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

### Task Overview:

- Utilized machine learning algorithms to predict survival based on passenger information.
- Explored the Titanic dataset, considering features such as age, gender, class, and more.

### Results:

- Achieved [accuracy: 0.82].

Feel free to explore the code  in this repository. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out!
